This is my **not** professional website. This site is where I post the random thoughts that swim in my empty brain. Topics to expect:

- Puppy related things
- Transfem struggles
- Sperging about software and foreign languages (esp. Japanese)
- The inner thoughts of a fujo
  <br>

## Info

This is a website styled to look like the Xbox 360 NXE menu. It has controller support included!

The stack is:

- VueJS
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
